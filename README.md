# Cycles

## Definitions:

- A (singly) linked list has a cycle if traversal of the list will result the in visiting the same node twice.

- A linked list is a circle it has a cycle containing the head.

- A linked list is a lollipop if it has a cycle but is but is not a circle.

## Goals:

- Write a method for your linked list class to classify linked lists as a circle, lollipop, or terminating.

- Write a has_cycle method for your linked list.

- Docstrings, PEP8, version control

## Reach Goals:

- Write a couple methods and call them from a dictionary using a keyword argument to fake a switch.

- Code review by peers.

- Develop an algorithm of your own before looking at hints.

- Use the Tortoise and Hare Algorithm.


# The Sign Out Front

The VP of Instruction asked Joe to solve the following problem:

Assume the sign cycles every 20 seconds, you can see and read the sign at the top of the hill for approximately 60 seconds (normal distribution, sd of 5), and there are 20 slides. What percentage of the slides will a student see if they come to school 4 days a week?

## Goals

- Write a script using a circular linked list to answer this question with some simulations.

- Take user input for these numbers.

## Reach Goals

- Keep settings in a json file, load defaults but let the user change them.

- Does the answer to this question change if they're randomly selected rather than on a cycle?
