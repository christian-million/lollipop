# Definitions:

- A linked list is a circle it has a cycle containing the head.

- A linked list is a lollipop if it has a cycle but is but is not a circle.

# Goals:

- Write a method for your linked list class to classify linked lists as a circle, lollipop, or terminating.

- Write a has_cycle method for your linked list.

- Docstrings, PEP8, version control

# Reach Goals:

- Write a couple methods and call them from a dictionary using a keyword argument to fake a switch.

- Code review by peers.

- Develop an algorithm of your own before looking at hints.

- Use the Tortoise and Hare Algorithm.
